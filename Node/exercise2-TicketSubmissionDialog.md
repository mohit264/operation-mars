# Exercise 2: Submitting Help Desk Tickets with the Bot (Node.js)

## Introduction

In this exercise you will learn how to add conversation abilities to the bot to guide the user to create a help desk ticket.

Inside [this folder](./exercise2-TicketSubmissionDialog) you will find a solution with the code that results from completing the steps in this exercise. You can use this solutions as guidance if you need additional help as you work through this exercise. Remember that for using it, you first need to run `npm install`.

## Prerequisites

The following software is required for completing this exercise:

* [Latest Node.js with NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
* A code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (preferred) or Visual Studio 2017 Community or higher
* The [Bot Framework Emulator](https://emulator.botframework.com) (make sure it's configured with the `en-US` Locale)

## Lab Notes

One thing you may notice is `app.js` becomes a bit long, with a mix of both server and bot code. This is done to make working through the lab easier. In more complex bots, you would typically break your bot across several files.

## Task 1: Adding Conversation to the Bot

In this task you will modify the bot to ask the user a sequence of questions before performing some action.

1. Open the `app.js` file you've obtained from the previous exercise. Alternatively, you can open the file from the [exercise1-EchoBot](./exercise1-EchoBot) folder.

1. Update the code the creates the UniversalBot connector with the following. You will notice the bot's message handler takes an array of functions, called a waterfall, instead of a single function. When a user sends a message to our bot, the first function in the waterfall will be called. This will greet the user and use the `text()` prompt him to describe the problem first. The SDK provides a set of built-in prompts to simplify collecting input from a user.

    The user's response will be passed to the second function in the waterfall which will confirm the description. This cascading sequence of questions and responses is what gives the waterfall feature its name.

    Also, the response is persisted in dialog data, which is used to persist information for a single dialog instance. This is essential for storing temporary information in between the steps of a waterfall in a dialog.

    ``` javascript
    var bot = new builder.UniversalBot(connector, [
        (session, args, next) => {
            session.send('Hi! I\'m the help desk bot and I can help you create a ticket.');
            builder.Prompts.text(session, 'First, please briefly describe your problem to me.');
        },
        (session, result, next) => {
            session.dialogData.description = result.response;
            session.send(`Got it. Your problem is "${session.dialogData.description}"`);
            session.endDialog();
        }
    ]);
    ```

1. Run the app from a console (`nodemon app.js`) and open the emulator. Type the bot URL as usual (`http://localhost:3978/api/messages`) and test the bot.

1. You can also check in the console window how the message handlers are executed one after the other.

    ![exercise2-console](./images/exercise2-console.png)

## Task 2: Prompting for the Tickets Details

In this task you are going to add more message handlers to the bot waterfall to prompt for all the ticket details.

1. Update the code which creates the UniversalBot connector with the following. It introduces two new types of prompts:

    * `Prompts.choice()`: To prompt for the severity of the ticket.
    * `Prompts.confirm()`: To confirm that the ticket information is correct.

    ```javascript
    var bot = new builder.UniversalBot(connector, [
        (session, args, next) => {
            session.send('Hi! I\'m the help desk bot and I can help you create a ticket.');
            builder.Prompts.text(session, 'First, please briefly describe your problem to me.');
        },
        (session, result, next) => {
            session.dialogData.description = result.response;

            var choices = ['high', 'normal', 'low'];
            builder.Prompts.choice(session, 'Which is the severity of this problem?', choices, { listStyle: builder.ListStyle.button });
        },
        (session, result, next) => {
            session.dialogData.severity = result.response.entity;

            builder.Prompts.text(session, 'Which would be the category for this ticket (software, hardware, networking, security or other)?');
        },
        (session, result, next) => {
            session.dialogData.category = result.response;

            var message = `Great! I'm going to create a "${session.dialogData.severity}" severity ticket in the "${session.dialogData.category}" category. ` +
                      `The description I will use is "${session.dialogData.description}". Can you please confirm that this information is correct?`;

            builder.Prompts.confirm(session, message, { listStyle: builder.ListStyle.button });
        },
        (session, result, next) => {
            if (result.response) {
                session.send('Awesome! Your ticked has been created.');
                session.endDialog();
            } else {
                session.endDialog('Ok. The ticket was not created. You can start again if you want.');
            }
        }
    ]);
    ```

    > **NOTE:** Notice that you can use Markdown syntax to create richer text messages. However it's important to note that not all channels support Markdown.

1. Re-run the app and use the 'Start new conversation' button of the emulator ![](./images/exercise2-start-new.png). Test the new conversation.

    ![exercise2-full-conversation-1](./images/exercise2-full-conversation-1.png)

    At this point if you talk to the bot again, the waterfall will start over.

## Task 3: Calling an External API to Save the Ticket

At this point you have all the information for the ticket, however that information is discarded when the waterfall ends. You will now add the code to create the ticket using an external API. For simplicity purposes, you will use a simple endpoint that saves the ticket into an in-memory array. In the real world, you can use any API that is accessible from your bot's code.

> **NOTE:** One important fact about bots to keep in mind is most bots you will build will be a front end to an existing API. Bots are simply apps, and they do not require artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), or natural language processing (NLP), to be considered a bot.

1. Create a new **ticketsApi.js** file in the root folder of the app and add the following code.

    ``` javascript
    var tickets = [];
    var lastTicketId = 1;

    module.exports = (req, res) => {
        console.log('Ticket received: ', req.body);
        let ticketId = lastTicketId++;
        var ticket = req.body;
        ticket.id = ticketId;
        tickets.push(ticket);

        res.send(ticketId.toString());
    };
    ```

## Task 4: Update the Server to Host the API

The steps below will help you clean up the code in `app.js` to better support the addition of the service. In addition, you'll update Restify to enable it to work with the API.

1. In the `app.js`, add the following require statement at the top of the file.

    ```javascript
    const ticketsApi = require('./ticketsApi');
    ```

1. Add the `listenPort` constant.

    ```javascript
    const listenPort = process.env.port || process.env.PORT || 3978;
    ```

1. Add the `ticketSubmissionUrl` constant.

    ```javascript
    const ticketSubmissionUrl = process.env.TICKET_SUBMISSION_URL || `http://localhost:${listenPort}`;
    ```

1. Update the `server.listen()` as show below.

    ```javascript
    server.listen(listenPort, '::', () => {
        console.log('Server Up');
    });
    ```

1. Add the `bodyParser`, which will enable the API to read the body of the message, and the Tickets API as shown below.

    ```javascript
    // Setup body parser and tickets api
    server.use(restify.bodyParser());
    server.post('/api/tickets', ticketsApi);
    ```

1. Replace the code of the **last message handler** with the following code that sends the dialogData to the Tickets API.

    ```javascript
    // --- existing code here ---
    (session, result, next) => {
        if (result.response) {
            var data = {
                category: session.dialogData.category,
                severity: session.dialogData.severity,
                description: session.dialogData.description,
            }

            const client = restify.createJsonClient({ url: ticketSubmissionUrl });

            client.post('/api/tickets', data, (err, request, response, ticketId) => {
                if (err || ticketId == -1) {
                    session.send('Something went wrong while I was saving your ticket. Please try again later.')
                } else {
                    session.send(`Awesome! Your ticked has been created with the number ${ticketId}.`);
                }

                session.endDialog();
            });
        } else {
            session.endDialog('Ok. The ticket was not created. You can start again if you want.');
        }
    }
    ```

1. Save the file and click the 'Start new conversation' button of the emulator ![exercise2-start-new](./images/exercise2-start-new.png). Test the full conversation again to check that the ticket id is returned from the API.

## Task 5: Change Notification Message to Show an Adaptive Card

In this task you will enhance the confirmation message that is shown to the user after the ticket using [Adaptive Cards](http://adaptivecards.io/). Adaptive Cards are an open card exchange format enabling developers to exchange UI content in a common and consistent way. Their content can be specified as a JSON object. Content can then be rendered natively inside a host application (Bot Framework channels), automatically adapting to the look and feel of the host.

To simplify the creation of the card, the card JSON has already been provided in the [ticket.json](../assets/exercise2-TicketSubmissionDialog/ticket.json) file. Typically you would have a structure already created for your content, and then dynamically add it in at runtime. Notice when exploring `ticket.json` the placeholders of `{ticketId}`, `{severity}`, `{category}` and `{description}`; you will locate those strings in the object and update them with the appropriate values.

1. At the root folder of your app, create a folder named **cards**. In the new folder, copy the **ticket.json** file from the [assets/exercise2](../assets/exercise2-TicketSubmissionDialog) folder on the root of this hands-on lab.

1. Open the `app.js` file you've obtained from the previous task. Add the `fs` module to read to the file as follows in the _require_ section.

    ```javascript
    const fs = require('fs');
    ```

1. At the end of the file, add the `createCard` function that will return the JSON file content, replacing the placeholders with the parameters.

    ```javascript
    const createCard = (ticketId, data) => {
        var cardTxt = fs.readFileSync('./cards/ticket.json', 'UTF-8');

        cardTxt = cardTxt.replace(/{ticketId}/g, ticketId)
                        .replace(/{severity}/g, data.severity)
                        .replace(/{category}/g, data.category)
                        .replace(/{description}/g, data.description);

        return JSON.parse(cardTxt);
    };
    ```

1. Locate the last waterfall step, and replace the following line:

    ```javascript
    session.send(`Awesome! Your ticked has been created with the number ${ticketId}.`);
    ```

    with this one:

    ```javascript
    session.send(new builder.Message(session).addAttachment({
        contentType: "application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive",
        content: createCard(ticketId, data)
    }));
    ```

1. Save the file and use the 'Start new conversation' button of the emulator ![exercise2-start-new](./images/exercise2-start-new.png). Test the new conversation. You should see the confirmation message as follows.

## Further Challenges

If you want to continue working on your own you can try with these tasks:

* Send a welcome message to the bot relying on the `conversationUpdate` event, as explained [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/nodejs/bot-builder-nodejs-handle-conversation-events#greet-a-user-on-conversation-join).
* Send a typing indicator to the bot while it calls the Tickets API, as explained [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/nodejs/bot-builder-nodejs-send-typing-indicator).
